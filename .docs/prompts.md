```

**File operations:**
```
Create a new file called "CONTRIBUTING.md" in my repository with standard contribution guidelines
```

**Branch management:**
```
Create a new feature branch called "feature/user-authentication" from the main branch in my repo
```

### Advanced Repository Workflows

**Bulk file operations:**
```
Push multiple files to create a basic Node.js project structure with package.json, index.js, and README.md
```

**Repository analysis:**
```
Analyze the commit history of the main branch for the last 30 commits and summarize the changes
```

**Search across repositories:**
```
Search for React components that implement authentication across all public repositories
```

## Issue Management

### Basic Issue Operations

**Create comprehensive issues:**
```
Create a bug report issue with the title "Login form validation not working" including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and labels
```

**Issue tracking and management:**
```
List all open issues labeled "bug" and "high-priority" in my repository and sort them by creation date
```

**Automated issue workflows:**
```
For all issues labeled "needs-triage", add a comment asking for more details and assign them to the project maintainer
```

### Advanced Issue Workflows

**Issue analytics:**
```
Analyze all closed issues from the past month to identify common patterns and create a summary report
```

**Copilot integration:**
```
Assign GitHub Copilot to work on issue #42 to automatically generate code solutions
```

## Pull Request Management

### Basic PR Operations

**Create pull requests:**
```
Create a pull request from feature/user-auth to main with a detailed description of the authentication implementation
```

**PR review workflows:**
```
Review the changes in PR #123, check for potential security issues, and leave detailed feedback
```

**Merge management:**
```
Check the status of all open pull requests and merge any that are approved and have passing CI
```

### Advanced PR Workflows

**Automated code review:**
```
For PR #456, create a pending review, add comments on any lines with TODO comments, then submit the review requesting changes
```

**PR analytics:**
```
Analyze the last 10 merged pull requests to calculate average review time and identify bottlenecks
```

**Batch PR operations:**
```
Update all open pull requests with the latest changes from their base branches
```

## GitHub Actions & CI/CD

### Workflow Management

**Monitor workflow runs:**
```
Show me the status of all workflow runs for the main branch in the last 24 hours
```

**Troubleshoot failures:**
```
Get the logs for all failed jobs in the latest workflow run and identify the root cause
```

**Trigger workflows:**
```
Run the deployment workflow on the production branch with the staging environment parameter
```

### Advanced CI/CD Workflows

**Automated failure analysis:**
```
For any failed workflow runs in the past week, download the logs and create a summary of common failure patterns
```

**Workflow optimization:**
```
Analyze workflow run durations and usage metrics to identify optimization opportunities
```

## Security & Code Quality

### Code Security Management

**Security alert monitoring:**
```
List all open code scanning alerts with high severity and create issues for each one with remediation suggestions
```

**Secret scanning:**
```
Check for any secret scanning alerts and help me understand the security implications
```

### Security Workflows

**Automated security reviews:**
```
Review the security posture of my repository by checking code scanning alerts, secret scanning results, and dependency vulnerabilities
```

**Security compliance:**
```
Generate a security report for my repository including all scanning results and remediation recommendations
```

## Notifications & Team Management

### Notification Management

**Inbox management:**
```
Show me all my unread GitHub notifications and categorize them by type (mentions, reviews, issues, etc.)
```

**Selective notification handling:**
```
Mark all notifications from archived repositories as read and unsubscribe from repositories I'm no longer working on
```

### Team Collaboration

**User and team operations:**
```
Find all GitHub users who contributed to the project in the last 6 months and create a contributors list
```

**Collaboration analytics:**
```
Analyze notification patterns to understand team collaboration frequency and response times
```

## Advanced Automation Workflows

### Cross-Repository Operations

**Multi-repo maintenance:**
```
For all repositories I own, check for outdated dependencies and create issues to track necessary updates
```

**Organization-wide analysis:**
```
Analyze all repositories in my organization to identify common patterns, popular technologies, and maintenance needs
```

### Intelligent Automation

**Smart issue triage:**
```
For all new issues without labels, analyze their content and automatically apply appropriate labels and assign relevant team members
```

**Automated project health checks:**
```
Perform a comprehensive health check on my repository including CI status, security alerts, outdated dependencies, and documentation quality
```

**Intelligent code review:**
```
For all open pull requests, analyze the changes and provide automated feedback on code quality, security, and best practices
```

### Development Workflow Automation

**Feature branch automation:**
```
Create a complete feature development workflow: create branch, implement basic structure, create PR with draft status, and set up required reviewers
```

**Release preparation:**
```
Prepare for a new release by checking all merged PRs since last release, updating changelog, and creating release notes
```

## Tips for Effective Usage

### Best Practices

1. **Use specific toolsets**: Enable only the toolsets you need using `--toolsets` flag for better performance
2. **Leverage context tools**: Always use context toolset to understand your current GitHub environment
3. **Combine operations**: Chain multiple operations together for complex workflows
4. **Use read-only mode**: For analysis and reporting tasks, use `--read-only` flag for safety

### Prompt Engineering Tips

1. **Be specific**: Include repository names, issue numbers, and specific criteria
2. **Set clear expectations**: Specify desired output format and level of detail
3. **Use progressive complexity**: Start with simple operations and build up to complex workflows
4. **Leverage AI analysis**: Ask for insights, patterns, and recommendations based on data

### Common Patterns

1. **Analysis â†’ Action**: First analyze the situation, then take appropriate action
2. **Batch operations**: Process multiple items with similar operations
3. **Conditional logic**: "If condition X, then action Y"
4. **Reporting and summaries**: Regular status reports and trend analysis

## Experimental Features

The `experiments` toolset includes cutting-edge features:

- Advanced PR analysis
- AI-powered code suggestions
- Predictive issue categorization
- Intelligent workflow optimization

Enable experiments with caution in production environments:
```
--toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,experiments
```

## Configuration Examples

### VS Code Setup
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker with Specific Toolsets
```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS="repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security" \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```
